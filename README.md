# The Movie DB - react app
http://danielzawadzki.com | @danzawadzki

An application based on the React library. Lets you search for information about movie in the TMDb database. 

The project was inspired by [Stephen Kempin](https://skempin.github.io/reactjs-tmdb-app/), who wrote similar application, but using a slightly different stack. I want to also thanks to [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for giving me access to their API.
